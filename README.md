# CollegeEventBookingApp
An app that helps you book your tickets for various events hosted throughout the year in your college.


WHY THIS APP :

Many events are hosted in our colleges throughout the academic year. There is Aatmatrisha, Epsilon, TAS, Prakalpa and so many more. But the first thing that comes to oneâ€™s mind is that for all these events they need to either book tickets (for concerts, stand-up, cultural events, etc) or register in events with a team. Generally, organisers choose spots across the college and decided to sell tickets and take in registrations for which students have to stand in long queues during breaks and after college and the organisers have to manage all the payments, registrations, paperwork and so much more. The entire process requires a lot of effort from both, the organisers and the students.

OUR SOLUTION TO THIS :
We plan to make this process as easy as just making a few taps on our android app "College Events Booking". Right from an organiser putting up an event and filling in all the necessary details about it, to any student being able to book a ticket for any event and easily complete the payments online. The student would then receive a QR code and a confirmation for his or her bookings. The QR code can then be scanned on the day of the event, eliminating any requirement of a physical ticket. A few hours prior to the event, the app will also notify the students regularly about the upcoming events.

FUTURE SCOPE :
At the current stage we plan to implement the app for events in PES University only. For our future ventures we would like to include other colleges and implement a map based feature to find out where exactly the event is being conducted in the college, include the option of online transactions, etc.
